Non-normality can signal issues like heteroscedasticity (non-constant error variance), the presence of outliers, or omitted variable bias.
Remediation:
Based on the histogram and Q-Q Plot which is slightly right skewed, we can conclude that the residuals deviate slightly from normality, so OLS may still perform adequately, particularly in our large sample where asymptotic normality applies.

Implications for OLS:
1) Unbiasedness: Non-normal residuals do not affect the unbiasedness of OLS estimators as long as key assumptions (like linearity,        exogeneity of regressors, and zero-mean error term) are satisfied
2) Efficiency:
OLS estimators may lose their efficiency because normality of residuals is necessary for OLS to be the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator  (BLUE) under the Gauss-Markov assumptions.
3) Hypothesis Testing:
The validity of tests (e.g., (t)-tests and (F)-tests) and confidence intervals relies on the normality assumption. Non-normal residuals         can lead to incorrect p-values
