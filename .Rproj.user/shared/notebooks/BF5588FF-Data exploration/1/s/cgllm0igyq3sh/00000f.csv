 EDUC (26.729, p < 0.001)

A one-year increase in education leads to a $26.73 increase in wages.
This is highly significant (p = 0.000).

AGE (2.226, p = 0.020)
A one-year increase in age increases wages by $2.23.
Significant at the 5% level (p = 0.020).

RACE (-77.478, p < 0.001)
Suggests a wage penalty of $77.48 for certain racial groups (assuming a binary variable where non-white = 1).
Highly significant (p = 0.000).

SMSA (-63.654, p < 0.001)
Living in an SMSA (Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area) is associated with a $63.65 lower wage.
Significant at p = 0.000.

MARRIED (77.927, p < 0.001)
Being married increases wages by $77.93.
Highly significant (p = 0.000).

Regional Effects on Wages

Significant Regions:
REGION2 (B = 41.204, p = 0.003)
REGION3 (B = 49.071, p = 0.0003)
REGION9 (B = 63.543, p = 0.00001)
These regions have higher wages compared to the reference region.

Non-Significant Regions:
REGION4, REGION5, REGION6, REGION7, REGION8 (p > 0.05)
These regions do not significantly differ from the reference region in terms of wages.

QOB:
being born in Q2 is associated with a $3.94 lower wage compared to Q1,
Being born in Q3 is associated with a $4.79 higher wage compared to Q1, while Being born in Q4 is associated with a $3.73 lower wage compared to Q1.None of the QOB coefficients are significant, meaning quarter of birth does not have a meaningful impact on wages in this model.
The p-values (all > 0.5) suggest that there is no strong evidence that being born in a particular quarter affects wages

While the model is statistically significant, it explains only 13.4% of the variation in wages. Other unobserved factors (e.g. experience, skills) likely play a major role."
